# Nim - Palo

Implementation of my Virtual Machine in the Nim programming language.

In this version I'm using an s-expression based format for the module files, instead of a custom text-based or a binary format, and the code is interpreted. I plan to type-check the programs before running, but that's for later, for now I just want this to Just Work.
